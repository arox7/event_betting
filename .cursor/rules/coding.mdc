- When writing code, do not use excessive fallbacks that hide errors. 
- Do not use excessive try/except. Errors are OK -- we must understand the root cause. 
- Do not use inline import statements -- move them to the top of files. 
- Do not duplicate logic if it is available elsewhere in the codebase.
