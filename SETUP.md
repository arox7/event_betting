# Setup Guide for Kalshi Market Analysis Dashboard

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
2. **Kalshi Account** with API access
3. **API Credentials** from Kalshi
4. **Gemini API Key** (optional, for AI features)

## Step 1: Get Kalshi API Credentials

1. Log in to your Kalshi account at [kalshi.com](https://kalshi.com)
2. Navigate to **Account Settings** â†’ **Profile Settings**
3. Go to the **API Keys** section
4. Click **"Create New API Key"**
5. **IMPORTANT**: Save both the **Private Key** and **Key ID** immediately - they won't be shown again!

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your credentials:

```env
# Kalshi API Configuration
KALSHI_API_KEY_ID=your-api-key-id-here
KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=path/to/private_key.pem

# Environment (demo or production)
KALSHI_DEMO_MODE=true
KALSHI_API_HOST=https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2

# Dashboard Configuration
DASHBOARD_PORT=8501
DASHBOARD_HOST=localhost

# Optional: Gemini AI Configuration (for AI features)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

## Step 3: Save Your Private Key

1. Create a file called `private_key.pem` in your project directory
2. Copy the private key from Kalshi (starts with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`)
3. Paste it into the file exactly as shown
4. Update the `KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` in your `.env` file to point to this file

Example:
```env
KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=./private_key.pem
```

## Step 4: Choose Environment

### Demo Environment (Recommended for Testing)
```env
KALSHI_DEMO_MODE=true
```
- Uses `https://demo-api.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2`
- Safe for testing with fake money
- Same API structure as production

### Production Environment
```env
KALSHI_DEMO_MODE=false
```
- Uses `https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2`
- Real money and real markets
- Use with caution!

## Step 5: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 6: Test Your Setup

```bash
python test_setup.py
```

This will:
- Test API connection
- Verify authentication
- Fetch sample markets
- Run screening test

## Step 7: Run the Dashboard

### Option 1: Use the startup script (recommended)
```bash
./run_dashboard.sh
```

### Option 2: Run directly
```bash
# Run dashboard
python main.py

# Or with custom port
python main.py --port 8502

# Or with Streamlit directly
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Private key file not found"**
   - Check the path in `KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`
   - Ensure the file exists and is readable

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Verify your API Key ID is correct
   - Check that the private key file contains the full key
   - Ensure no extra spaces or characters in the key

3. **"No markets found"**
   - Check if you're in demo mode vs production
   - Verify the API host URL is correct
   - Check your internet connection

4. **"Health check failed"**
   - Verify your API credentials
   - Check if Kalshi API is accessible
   - Try switching between demo and production

5. **"AI features not working"**
   - Check if GEMINI_API_KEY is set in your .env file
   - Verify the API key is valid
   - Check your internet connection

### Demo vs Production

- **Demo**: Safe testing environment with fake money
- **Production**: Real markets with real money - use carefully!

### API Rate Limits

Kalshi has rate limits on API requests. The dashboard fetches data on-demand rather than continuously, which helps avoid rate limiting issues.

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file or private key to version control
- Keep your private key and API keys secure and don't share them
- Use demo mode for testing and development
- Only use production mode when analyzing real markets
- Keep your Gemini API key secure as well

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Run the test setup script to diagnose problems: `python test_setup.py`
3. Verify your API credentials are correct
4. Check Kalshi's API documentation for any changes
5. For AI features, verify your Gemini API key is working
